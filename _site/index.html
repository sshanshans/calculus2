      <section>
      <p>Calculus studies two ideas, the effects of the way things change and the idea of the mathematical infinite. In your previous high school calculus class, you have encountered these ideas in finding the derivative of a function. This course will continue in a slightly different setting, which is integration and series. We will start our journey with the development of an integral using the infinitesimal idea in chapter 7, and apply the techniques to geometry, probability, physics, and economics in chapter 8.</p>
