There is a weekly laboratory that will introduce new topics, reinforce the topics covered in class, or explore applications of calculus. This is an important part of the course. The midterms and the final exam will include questions related to the labs. Following labs, you will either have an individual quiz or be required to hand in a group report on your work. You are responsible for finding your own lab groups -- use this as an opportunity to meet new friends and learn from each other. Each lab group should consist of at least 4 people but no more than 5. The names of all group members should be written on any submitted work. If one member did not fully participate, then that person's name must be omitted. A second report from the missing partner will not be accepted at a later date without previous permission from me. If such a situation arises, contact me as soon as possible. 

During the labs, you will often need to use a computer algebra system called Maple. Duke [OIT](https://software.duke.edu) has a student discounted version of Maple that you can purchase for your own computer. You will be expected to bring your lab manual and computer (with Maple) to every lab. 

Your attendance to lab is required. There will be no make-up quizzes, and individual lab reports will not be accepted, except in the following cases: <br>

* serious illness only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean.  <br>
* serious illness or death in the family only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean.  <br>
* athletic commitments or religious obligations only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean and prior notice is given. In such cases, rescheduled quizzes must be taken before the rest of the class. <br>

Please consult your peers for what's missed, and turn in an individual report if a group report is assigned for the missing lab.
