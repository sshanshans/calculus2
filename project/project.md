title: Buffon's needle
description: project
--- 
In this project, you will explore one of the oldest problems in the field of geometrical probability. It was first stated in 1777 by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips. The question can be solved using integration techniques, and the solution can be used to design a Monte Carlo method for approximating the number pi.
